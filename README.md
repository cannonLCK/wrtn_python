        "id": "name@example.com",
        "pw": "example_password",
        "key": "eyJhXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.eyJXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        //refresh key
    },
```
If you don't know how to get the refresh_key, don't worry, as long as you input the id and pw correctly, it will automatically update the refresh_key.
